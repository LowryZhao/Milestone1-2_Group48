## 1. System Vision

### 1.1 Problem Background

- Problem Identification:
  With the continuous development of living standards, people's demand for health and nutrition is increasing, but few   
  people go back to consult professional nutrition analyst and doctors. The development of this software is aimed at 
  helping people search and view specific information about the nutrients contained in various foods more easily and 
  quickly.
  
- Dataset:
  The dataset used by this software is Nutritional-Food-Database provided by the course, which contains detailed 
  nutritional information of various foods. These data include the names of various foods, as well as the specific values 
  of the nutrients provided, such as calories, fat, protein, and vitamins.
 
- Data Input/Output:
  
  Input:
  - Users can enter the name of a food in the search bar, click to select a specific food, or choose a specific range of 
    nutrients.
 
  Output:
  - By searching for the name of a food, specific data on all nutrients contained in that food will be displayed.
  - By selecting a single food, pie charts and bar charts will be displayed.
  - By screening the specifc range of nutrients, foods that meet the standards will be displayed.
 
- Target Users:
  - Nutritionist: Analyze and recommend foods based on different dietary needs.
  - Healthcare Professionals: Assess and provide recommendations based on health status.
  - The General Public: Improving health.
  

### 1.2 System capabilities/overview

- System Functionality:
  - Search and filtering: Users can search for food names and filter based on specific nutritional standards.
  - Data analysis and visualization: The system will allow users to analyze the nutritional composition of various foods       and visualize this data in a meaningful way.
  - Customization: Users can set their own unique nutrition plan and share it.

- Features and Functionalities:
  - Food search: Users can search for food by name and view detailed nutritional information.
  - Nutritional Analysis: For any selected food, users can view a detailed breakdown of its nutritional components through 
    pie charts and bar charts.
  - Nutritional Range Filter: Users can filter food by specifying the range of any nutritional indicator.
  - Nutrient Level Filter: Users can filter food based on pre-defined key nutrient levels (low, medium, high).
  - Nutrition Plan Development and Sharing: Users can create different nutrition plans and share them. Professionals can 
    use this feature to assist some confused users and provide them with a template.


### 1.3	Benefit Analysis

  - Time Saving: It saves users the time they need to collect information on their own, providing convenience not only for 
    ordinary users, but also for professionals and doctors.
  - Decision Making: By providing more accurate and professional data, users can analyze and make better decisions. Users 
    can also refer to plans shared by other users.
  - Health: By providing professional data to help users improve their health status and reduce the risk of illness.


## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 User Requirements

Detail how users are expected to interact with or use the program. What functionalities must the system provide from the end-user perspective? This can include both narrative descriptions and a listing of user needs.

Note: Since no specific client or user is assigned, you may create a fictional user. Who do you envision using your software?

Fictional User: Sarah, Nutritionist

Sarah is a 32-year-old nutritionist who runs her own practice. She works with a diverse clientele, including athletes, individuals with specific dietary restrictions, and people looking to improve their overall health through nutrition. Sarah needs a robust software system that can leverage the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database to help her create personalized meal plans, analyze nutritional intake, and provide evidence-based recommendations to her clients.

User needs:

1.	Food Search and Filtering:

   - Users should be able to search for specific food items by name, category, or nutritional content.
   - The system must provide advanced filtering options (e.g., by macronutrients, micronutrients, allergens).

2.	Nutritional Information Display:
   - For each food item, the system should display comprehensive nutritional information as provided in the database.
   - Users should be able to view nutritional data in various units (e.g., grams, ounces, cups) and adjust serving sizes dynamically.

3.	Meal Planning:
   - Users should be able to create and save meal plans for their clients.
   - The system must allow users to add food items to meal plans and automatically calculate total nutritional values.

4.	Nutritional Analysis:
   - The system should provide tools for analyzing the nutritional content of meals, daily intake, or custom time periods.
   - Users should be able to generate reports showing nutritional breakdowns, including macronutrient ratios and micronutrient levels.

5.	Client Management:
   - Users should be able to create and manage client profiles, including personal information, dietary restrictions, and health goals.
   - The system must allow users to associate meal plans and nutritional analyses with specific clients.

6.	Comparison Tools:
   - Users should be able to compare nutritional values of different food items side-by-side.
   - The system should provide functionality to find alternative food items with similar nutritional profiles.

7.	Data Export and Reporting:
   - Users should be able to export nutritional data, meal plans, and analyses in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
   - The system must generate professional-looking reports for clients, summarizing meal plans and nutritional insights.
